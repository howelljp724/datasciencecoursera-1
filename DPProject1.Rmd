## Instructions

1.Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

2.Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

3.Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

### Most populated cities in Bay area
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(leaflet)

  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(weight = 0.05, radius = sqrt(BA_cities$pop) * 15)
